# Scraper _Mini-Project_

This is a project using **Puppeteer** and **NodeJS**.

Why _'Mini-Project'_ you're asking ?  
It's one brick of a bigger project that I'm currently developping as I'm learning code and _how to code_ in general.  

### Okay, but what's it doing ?

- Goes to a specified URL of a specific website
- Retrieve informations, JSON ready
- (Repeat for each URL provided)  
- Write locally the JSON output

### Bonus feature:

While testing and tuning the code, I started to find annoying the **lack of feedback**!  
My solution as a junior software developer: coding a progress bar! _(I promise you, it's ***fun***)_
